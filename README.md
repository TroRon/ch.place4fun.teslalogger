# TeslaLogger

This application offers the possibility to react to events of the TeslaLogger within Homey.

The application only reads data from the TeslaLogger and cannot influence the logger data.

> Important: The application obtains its data from the TeslaLogger via an interface. If the developers change something or switch off the interface, this application will have no function.
