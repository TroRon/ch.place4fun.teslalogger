Do you have a TeslaLogger installation that logs your car's data?

Do you want to easily view the data, preferably through Homey?

Then I have something for you:
Extend Homey with the ability to display and interact with data from your TeslaLogger.

The possibilities are endless when you expand Homey with this feature.

Have fun with this app!
